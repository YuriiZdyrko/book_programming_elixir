OTP defines systems in terms of hierarchies of applications.

Application = one or more processes

These processes follow OTP behaviours (GenServer, GenSupervisor etc.).

Each behariour implementation runs in it's own process.


GenServer.start_link is similar to Process.spawn_link

!!USEFUL!!
GenServer.start_link(module, init_arg, [debug: [:trace]])

or dynamically:
iex> :sys.trace pid, true

iex(31)> GenServer.call(pid, :next_number)
*DBG* <0.244.0> got call next_number from <0.184.0>
*DBG* <0.244.0> sent 12 to <0.184.0>, new state 13
